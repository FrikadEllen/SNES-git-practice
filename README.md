# SNES-git-practice

This is a simple reposirtory that we will use to practice our git skills 

Steps that you will take during this workshop

1. Fork this repository to your github account
2. link your copy of the repo to a project in R 
3. make some changes using the commint, pull, push cycle
4. create a pull request to merge your changes into the master repo (my copy that you origionally forked)
5. smugly bask in your newfound git glory
